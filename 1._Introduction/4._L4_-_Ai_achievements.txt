====== 4. L4 - Ai achievements ======
Created Monday 05 October 2020

* Who coined the name AI - John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky and Claude Shannon
* Better names could be - Synthetic Intelligence, heuristic programming, machine intelligence
* The name AI has stuck

* MIT, CMU, Stanford etc were some of the places where AI was being developed.
--------------------
* Simon and Newell defined the Information-Processing approach for AI. i.e we can work at the knowledge, or information level.
* In other words, all we need is data structures and algorithms which operate on them.
* This is called classical AI or symbolic AI.
--------------------
Architecture for AI:
1. Symbol - must stand for something meaningful
2. Symbol system - words, arrays, lists, even a tune
3. Physical Symbol System - A symbol system which obeys laws of some kind, a formal system - long division, an abacus, an algorithm
* **The Physical Symbol System Hypothesis**

* Symbolic AI requires explicit representation of parameters.
* Weights of an ANN are not symbols.
--------------------
Fear of ML:
1. Frankenstein(Novel)
2. Asimov's laws of robotics(fictitious)
--------------------
* Chess and other board games were the first
* Recommender systems
* ALVINN
* ASIMO
* KIROBO
* AIBO
