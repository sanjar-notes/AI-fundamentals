====== 4. L13 - Tabu Search ======
Created Monday 12 October 2020

**Escaping local maxima**
* In hill climbing, we are doing 'exploitation' of the gradient, which can result in a local optima.
* To avoid getting stuck, we need to make a move against the heuristic function, or the ability for 'exploration'.

--------------------
Hill climbing does this

But we actually need an element of exploration in order to evade from the local optima. We need to design the allowed filter here.

This introduces two problems:
1. How to stop - small problem - we'll used time based criteria, and store the best soln ever.
2. How to avoid looping - by tabooing some moves. Ways to do this:
	a. use a CLOSED set
	b. keep a track of the changes/perturbations, and don't repeat them for some time(called tabu tenure). In other words, taboo some perturbations. This is called **Tabu Search**. Tabu is a actually taboo spelled in a diferent way.
	c. Have a frequency table of changes.
Tabu Search works well for SAT and TSP(non-arbitrary)

--------------------
* Experimentally, it has been found that Tabu search works very well.
* We need to moderate the exploration too, which is achieved by specifying an **aspiration criteria** - i.e if all the allowed moves the current best solution is also inferior than the best non-tabu move, then allow the tabu move.
* Tabu search is incomplete, but it works with high probabitlity. This is one of the best way to fight combEx.

**Stochastic/Random Methods**
1. Random walk - select the random neighbour and go to that. It is incomplete.

2. A probability based walk
	Select the neighbour according to the rule (probability(eval(n)-eval(c)) ∝ improvement) where the probability is neighbour is selected if a generated random fraction is >= probability.
