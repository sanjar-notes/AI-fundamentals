====== 4. L21 - Montone property, IDA star ======
Created Tuesday 20 October 2020

What happens if a heuristic function is tighter(higher while still being an underestimate) than another function. How does this affect A*.

* Monotone or consistency property - h(neighbor) - h(n) <= d(neighbor, n). All edges are underestimated.
* If a heuristic function satisfies the monotone property, then it is optimal at each iteration. There is no need for propagation.
