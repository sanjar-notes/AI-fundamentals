====== 6. L25 - AO star ======
Created Tuesday 20 October 2020

* Both are equivalent
{{./pasted_image.png?width=400}}
--------------------
* We are using a heuristic function here.

AO* pseudo-code
{{{code: lang="prolog" linenumbers="True"
while S is not SOLVED and h(s) < FUTILITY:
	/*FORWARD PHASE - root to the leaves*/
	Follow the markers to set of Nodes N
	Pick some n in N:
		if n is unexpandable:
			f(n) = UTILITY
			continue
		generate children C of n
			remove Loops
			For each child in C:
				compute h(child)
	/*BACKWARD PHASE*/
	Go back and update heuristic values of parents
	Mark best sub solutions
	Label parents if we have reached a goal node
}}}

* If a node is unexpandable, set its heuristic value to FUTILITY
* For the star we need underestimation.
* AO* is not optimal
